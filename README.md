## Description

For challenge 14 of the UM Coding Bootcamp, I had to create a tech blog using backend api routes, server, and database. I also had to incorporate a user-friendly mobile responsive frontend using handlebars, home routes, and JavaScript. Password encryption was required to successfully store a user to the database. I incorporated new CSS framework, Tailwind, to style the frontend.
